''' This code provides two versions, each with a different value for the alien_color variable.
In the first version, where alien_color is 'green', the code prints a message stating that the player earned 5 points.
In the second version, where alien_color is 'red', the code prints a message indicating that the player earned 10 points.
These versions demonstrate how the program's response changes based on the value of alien_color. '''
