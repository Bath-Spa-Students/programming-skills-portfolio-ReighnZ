''' This code creates an infinite loop using 'while True'. This loop will run indefinitely until manually stopped.
It includes a 'pass' statement, which acts as a placeholder, ensuring the loop has some content.
To exit the loop, you need to interrupt its execution, such as by pressing Ctrl-C or closing the program or terminal. '''
