''' The datetime module is imported, offering classes and functions for managing dates and times.

To get the current date and time it uses the datetime.datetime.now() function.

Using the strftime method, it formats the current date and time as a string. It is structured as "Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second" in this instance.

The formatted date and time are then printed to the console. '''

import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print ("Current date and time : ")
print (now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
