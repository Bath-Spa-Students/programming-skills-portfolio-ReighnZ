''' This code creates three different text strings and stores them in variables:
string_1 contains "Hello, ".
string_2 contains "Welcome to ".
string_3 contains "Code Lab 1."

It then combines these three strings together using the + operator and stores the result in a new variable called string_4.

It then prints the value of string_4 to the screen. '''

string_1 = "Hello, "
string_2 = "Welcome to "
string_3 = "Code Lab 1."
string_4 = string_1 + string_2 + string_3
print(string_4)
