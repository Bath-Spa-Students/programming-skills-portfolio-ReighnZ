# The first exercise is a Python code prints out the lyrics of the nursery rhyme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" using multiline string and the print statement.
# The print statement is used to display text in the console.
# The text being printed is enclosed within triple double-quote """ characters. This allows us to create a multiline string, which means we can write multiple lines of text without having to use separate print statements for each line.

print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are""")
