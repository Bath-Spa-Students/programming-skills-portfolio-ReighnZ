''' In this code, a quote by Taylor Swift is assigned to the variable quote, and the author's name, Taylor Swift, is assigned to the variable author.
Using an f-string, the code combines these variables and presents them as a sentence, with the quote enclosed in quotation marks, attributing it to the author.
When executed, the code prints the combined sentence, effectively showcasing a quote from Taylor Swift. '''

quote = "Just be yourself, there is no one better."
author = "Taylor Swift"
print(f"{author} once said, \"{quote}\"")
